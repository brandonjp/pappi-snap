PappiSnap!
a very simple Chrome extension for Mac only that snaps the current webpage using the Mac app Paparazzi!

PappiSnap! Instantly and easily create a PDF, PNG, JPG or TIF of the full webpage in your current tab.  One click on the PappiSnap! icon sends the current url to the Mac-only Paparazzi! app by Nate Weaver - http://derailer.org/paparazzi/  NOTE: This extension (obviously) only works on Macs with Paparazzi!.app installed.

You most definitely need to download Paparazzi! before using my extension.  Do that here: http://bit.ly/paparazziapp  

I have no affiliation with the Paparazzi app, other than I might be quoted on Twitter for saying that I love it.  I even used the Paparazzi icon without permission.
