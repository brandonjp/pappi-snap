PappiSnap!
a very simple Chrome extension for Mac only that snaps the current webpage using the Mac app Paparazzi!

You most definitely need to download Paparazzi! before using my extension.  Do that here: http://bit.ly/paparazziapp  

I have no affiliation with the Paparazzi app, other than I might be quoted on Twitter for saying that I love it.  I even used the Paparazzi icon without permission.
